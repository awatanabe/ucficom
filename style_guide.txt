STYLE GUIDE FOR FICOM WEB PORTAL

/*
 * Basic conventions
 */

// Constructor Classes
- Load helpers, then libraries, then models. Each should be in alphabetical order.
- Do not load view classes (table, table_form, html). This is done through Display library

// Quotes
-  PHP code should use double quotes ("") and all HTML should use single quotes ('').

// Messages
- Liberal use of messages is OK
- Default message styling is MESSAGE_NORMAL we should be used for basic notices.
- MESSAGE_SUCCESS should be used when information in the database is updated.
- MESSAGE_ALERT should be used when there is an error.

/*
 * Databases
 */

// Table types
- Primary Tables: Those tables that have their own models (i.e. users, groups, etc.) with 
identifying information.
- Secondary Tables: Also Dependent Tables. Tables that contain irregular information that are
accessed in relation to an element in the primary table.
- Reference Tables: Tables that are lookups for values in primary or secondary tables.

// Primary Tables
- Contain "metadata" (most basically the name) on a type of primary element in the table. Primary
tables should be short - they should contain enough information to identify an element (i.e. the 
type of information in a summary table of users, grants, groups, etc).

// Dependent Tables
- These contain irregular information related to individual elements in the primary table. For
example, "groups_notes" contains note information for groups. Some groups may have no notes; others
may have several. Thus it is "irregular" because it does not necessarily apply to each group.

// Reference Tables
- Allow for some degree of abstractions for labels and types.

// Table naming
- All table names should be plural
- Dependent tables (i.e. table dependent on a primary) should have names prefixed by the primary
table name

// Column naming
- Dependent table columns should have the singular of the table name prefixing the column name

// Users.security_level, groups.type or similar field
- The value "zero" is reserved for deactivated/canceled entries and should not otherwise be used

/** Table Descriptions **/

/* Users */

only 920px wide to account for padding.
